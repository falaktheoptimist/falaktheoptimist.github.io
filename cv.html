				<p>Research Scientist working on Machine Learning and Computer Vision Projects at <em><a href="http://infocusp.in/" title="Infocusp">Infocusp</a></em>.</p> Currently working with our client Cerebellum Capital, a hedge fund based in SF on their financial modelling tasks. This involves application of Machine Learning for discovery of new trading strategies.<br>	
				We recently cocluded a project aimed at visualizing and gaining insights into CNNs using TensorFlow - <a href = "https://github.com/InFoCusp/tf_cnnvis">check it out</a>.		
				<h2>Education</h2>

				<h2>Experience</h2>
				<p><strong>Research Scientist, Infocusp 2015-present</strong></p>
				<ul>
				<li> Working with our client, Cerebellum Capital (CCI) on employing Machine learning to discover and improve upon trading strategies
				<li> Designed a portfolio optimizer for CCI which involved translating their financial domain constraints and concepts
				into a convex optimization problem </li>
				<li> Working on project "Deepdive" aimed at understanding the innards of Convolutional Neural networks. We aim
				to develop a library for visual representation of the network layers. </li>
				<li> Part of my job is keeping up-to-date with the state of the art research/ tools in the fields of ML and Computer vision.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><strong>Graduate Teaching Assistant</strong></p>
				<ul>
				<li>Digital Signal Processing (DSP): Conducted lab sessions for the course. The labs designed in Matlab covered basic DSP concepts such as fourier tranform, z transform, filtering, Nyquist sampling and interpolation.  </li> 
				<li>Signals And Systems: Conducted tutorial sessions for the course on topics: A/D conversion, impulse response and transfer functions, transforms, </li>
				<li>Analog And Digital Communication: ADC labs were designed in Labview. </li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><strong>Intern, Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) </strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>The overall goal of the internship was to design a kalman filter based FLL assisted PLL tracking loop for the GPS receiver. It makes the tracking loop more robust against ionospheric scintillations. </li>
					<li>This involved understanding the working of the GPS receiver, more in depth study of the tracking loop and the effect of ionospheric scintillations on the signal. Also, learnt the working of kalman filter in detail.</li>
					<li>The addition of kalman filter in the loop has the advantage of retaining lock even during the periods of signal outage thus avoiding the costly re-acquisition procedure. </li>
				</ul>
